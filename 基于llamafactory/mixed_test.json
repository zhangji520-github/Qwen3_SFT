Line $l$ has equations $x = 1 + 4t$ and $y = 4 + 3t$, while line $m$ has equations $x = -5 + 4s$ and $y = 6 + 3s.\nNext, I recognize that points $A$ and $B$ can be expressed in terms of parameters $t$ and $s$.

The direction vector of line $m$ can be computed from its parameters as $\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\right\\}$.\nNext, I calculate the vector $\\rightarrow{BA}$, which is given by: $\\begin{pmatrix} (1 + 4t) - (-5 + 4s) \\ (4 + 3t) - (6 + 3s) \\right\\} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 + 4t - 4s \\ -2 + 3t - 3s \\right\\}.$\nNow that I have $\\rightarrow{BA}$, I need to project this vector onto the direction vector of line $m$, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\right\\}$.

Substituting gives: y = 30 - 19 = 11.\nWe have our two numbers: x = 19 (larger) and y = 11 (smaller).\nNext, we need to find the positive difference between these two numbers.\nThe positive difference is calculated as: |x - y| = |19 - 11| = 8.\nThus, the positive difference between the two numbers is 8.</think>\nLet the two numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$.\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n$x+y=30$ and $2x - 3y = 5$.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination.\nLet's solve it by elimination.
