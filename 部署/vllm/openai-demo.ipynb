      "<think>We need to express the quadratic $x^2 + 100x + c$ in the form $(x + d)^2$.\n",
      "The square of a binomial $(x + d)^2$ expands to $x^2 + 2dx + d^2$.\n",
      "Comparing the coefficients, we see that $2d = 100$, which gives us $d = 50$.\n",
      "Now, substituting $d = 50$ into the expanded form, we get $(x + 50)^2 = x^2 + 100x + 50^2$.\n",
      "Calculating $50^2$ gives us $2500$.\n",
      "Therefore, the constant $c$ must be $2500$.\n",
      "Thus, the value of the constant $c$ is 2500.</think>\n",
      "To express $x^2 + 100x + c$ as the square of a binomial, we need to find two numbers that add up to 100 and multiply to $c$.\n",
      "Let's call these two numbers $a$ and $b$. Then we have the equations $a + b = 100$ and $ab = c$.\n",
      "We can solve for $a$ and $b$ by factoring the quadratic equation $x^2 + 100x + c = 0$.\n",
      "Factoring gives us $(x + a)(x + b) = 0$, which means $x = -a$ or $x = -b$.\n",
      "Since the quadratic equation has two equal roots, we know that $a = b$.\n",
      "Substituting this into the equation $a + b = 100$, we get $2a = 100$ and $a = 50$.\n",
      "Since $ab = c$, we have $50 \\cdot 50 = c$ and $c = \\boxed{2500}$.\n",
      "The answer is: 2500\n"
